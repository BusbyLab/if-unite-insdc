## Overview

While the UNITE general FASTA releases represent high-quality, dynamically clustered references for fungal taxon assignment, most releases consistently ignore taxa that I care about. Also, I've noticed that the taxonomic ranks applied are not always the most up-to-date when compared with what Index Fungorum reports, and many of the included sequences lack detailed taxonomic resolution.

Starting from the most recent (as of `r Sys.Date()`) fungal UNITE+INSD release, this repo does the following:

- Removes sequences not identified to genus
- De-replicates sequences with the same header taxonomy and sequence
- Updates the taxonomy of the remaining sequences according to Index Fungorum
- De-replicates sequences (again) with the same header taxonomy and sequence
- Formats sequences headers in a format compatible with the `assignTaxonomy()` function from `dada2`

Because UNITE does not include the authority in the applied taxonomy, this approach ends up shedding more sequences as a conservative measure, only including sequences with unambiguous taxonomy. Also, because data dumps of Index Fungorum taxonomy (which are difficult to find anyways!) appear to only allow indexing at the genus-level, a genus-level ID requirement is placed on the UNITE+INSD release. This approach also doesn't apply the dynamic clustering that UNITE applies for it's species hypotheses and operates with the assumption that the IDs in the UNITE+INSD release (which have apparently already undergone some QAQC by UNITE) are reliable.

**The updated fungal taxonomy reference is found in the `02-rename` directory, named `if-unite-insdc.fa.gz`.**

This whole repo will (hopefully) become obsolete if:

- future releases include species hypotheses of taxa currently only found in UNITE+INSD releases
- fungal taxonomy of future releases matches Index Fungorum's

Planned improvements include:

- inclusion of sequences at higher ranks (dependent on Index Fungorum data dumps)
- application of dynamic clustering thresholds

## Reproducibility

All packages were installed and managed with `conda`.
```{bash conda, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, comment=""}

conda --version
cat config.yml

```

Install the above bioinformatic environment from `config.yml` using the script `00-build.sh`
```
# Clone the repo (using the GitHub CLI tool) ####
gh repo clone gerverska/if-unite-insdc

# Run the build script ####
bash code/00-build.sh
```
